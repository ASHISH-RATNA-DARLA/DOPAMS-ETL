We concealed our presence and I deputed one PC M.Sandeep. PC 4442in mufti with instructions to keep watch on the suspected persons & Vehicle and to apprehend them, on their identification. The suspected vehicle Swift Dzire Car  Br.No. AP 31 BU 0014 arrived at the toll plaza at 17.27 hours and the deputed PC identified the car at the toll plaza and approached the car taking all precautions and detained the inmates of the car and immediately we also approached the suspect car.

I introduced myself, my staff and mediators to the suspect and also informed them about the information received by me and the purpose of his apprehension.  On questioning him he revealed his names as Nakul Kailash Gaikawad S/o Kailash, age: 36 yrs, Caste: Munnuru kapu, Occu: driver, r/o Ramnagar, Backside of Reliance petrol bunk, beed town, and District, Maharastra State, N/o Dhabhigalli, Markandeya mandir, Kinwat madal, Nanded District, Maharastra state, Cell No. 8624810833.further questioning him about the information received by me, they voluntarily confessed that he is transporting Ganja in the car, then I have questioned him if is there any contraband NDPS substance in your personal possession?. He stated that he is not carrying any Narcotic substance in his personal possession, I told him that possession and transportation of Ganja is an offence under NDPS Act.

     Then I recorded the confessional cum seizure panchanama of them, at 1740 hours in the presence of the mediators in which he stated that  “I am one and only son to me parents. My  mother was died when i was child and my father was also died in accident in the year 2009. As of now iam takes rented room in myvillage. He was studied till 8 th class later stopped study. when my villager and friend i.e Pramoda was working as lorry driver belongs to the named by Sachin on that he went to the same as a cleaner. At that time Pramod would occasionally bring ganja from Barampur district of Orissa in a small amount in a lorry without anyone knowing as per Sachin's instructions and give it to Sachin, but he would give more money to Pramod. At that time, it came to know that Sachin who is owner of lorry, was doing ganja business. I thought that if I did this job, I too would earn a lot of money like Pramod and I could do well with it. That way, when I went with Pramod as a cleaner, I agreed to bring ganja together with him and many times we brought ganja together without anyone suspecting it. That way, from then on, I would go to the place he told me to work for, bring ganja in cars without anyone suspecting it and give it to Sachin. Every time I brought ganja, he would give me money from 15000/- to 20000/-. During the transporting I was caught by the police four times in this illegal trafficking of ganja. And registered cases in Beed Maharashtra Police, Rajahmundry, Bhavanipuram PS in Vide Crime No. 545/2024 U/s  8(c),20(b)(ii)(B)-NDPSA of NTR District, Andhra Pradesh Police, and Madhapur (Hyderabad) police stations Vide Cr.No.832/2023 U/s 20(b)(2) NDPS Act. when I was caught in a ganja case and sent to jail on remand. Even after coming out of jail on bail, I used to go to the Sachin told me to and bring ganja. However, since the risk in this ganja trafficking was high and Sachin gave me less money, I got acquainted with a Setu from Uttar Pradesh, whose name is 9028242791, 8452031469. I do not know his name, but whenever I talk to him on the phone, I called him Setu. I have been working under Setu for some time now. However, on 26.02.2025. Setu called me and told me to go to Kannur Palem village Visakhapatnam in a car and bring ganja, and I agreed to it. Later, Setu called me and told me to come to Alibut, Ahmednagar state and stay at Gaurav Hotel there. I left my house and reached the hotel On 27.02.2025 at about 16.00 hrs. While there, a person named Bayya, who is a Setu assistant was came to me and gave me a Swift Dzire car Br.No.AP 31 BU 0014 and Rs. 32000/-. There were two fake number plates in that car, one of which belonged to the state of Maharashtra and another name plate of state of Andhra Pradesh. Firstly I arranged for a fake number plate of the state of Maharashtra for the car. Bayya  is a person named Veera Babu, whom I already knew, gave me the phone number 9347328818, and I called Veera Babu, and he asked me to come to Tallapalem, Visakhapatnam district and called him.

 	On the same day, I left alone in such a car and left from Alibut, Maharashtra, via Jaipur, Umarga, Sangareddy, Hyderabad, Vijayawada, Rajahmundry, and reached Kannur Palem village in   Anakapalli district,Visakhapatnam on 28.02.2025 at midnight hours. After reaching there, I called Veera Babu and he brought 51 ganja packets in two wooden bags, each packet is weighing 2 kg and a total of 102 kg of ganja wrapped in brown color. I took them out of the bags and loaded the 51 packets in the trunk of the car and I make OLA cab taxi number plates which is one MH 04 ET 3259 another  number plate is AP 31 BU 0014 for cheating  and carrying  cutting player, Screwdriver. On the same night on 01.03.2025 at 01.00 midnight, I left Kannur Palem village alone in a car. I was driving towards Alibut, Maharashtra, via Rajahmundry, Vijayawada, Suryapet, Chautuppal, Hyderabad. When I reached the Chautuppal Mandalam panthangi toll plaza, the policeman in the mufti at the tollgate stopped my car and I tried to flee. The policeman there  caught me and arrested me. Later I found two number plates i.e MH 04 ET 3259( used to Front & back) on that I checked in 3rd eye police and found that original Number Register br.no. ( Original Number is MH12FK6065),  Vechicle Chassis :	MA3FKEB2S00170515   Engine Number :D13A1215750.
