# NOTES FOR TESTING:
# ============================================================================
# - All PostgreSQL queries use actual table and column names from schema_reference.py
# - All MongoDB queries use UPPERCASE field names (as per fir_records collection)
# - Date formats should match database format (timestamp without time zone)
# - Some queries may return empty results if data doesn't exist
# - Text search queries use ILIKE pattern matching for similarity
# - Join queries may need proper relationship understanding
# - Statistics queries should work with actual data counts
